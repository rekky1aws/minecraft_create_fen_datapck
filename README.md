# Minecraft Datapack for Create and FabricaeExNihilo compatibilty

I'm making this datapack for my skyblock modpack based on Create and FabricaeExNihilo. It mostly add crafts using the two mods.

## Recipes
### Barrel
 + A zombie above a barrel with produce blood

### Shaped Crafting
 + `Budding Amethyst` can be crafted with `Amethyst Shards`, `Emeralds` and `Diamonds`. It then can be automated with Create.
 + `Zinc Ingots` can be crafted with `Iron Ingots` and `Copper Ingots` *(this may be removed in the future sicne it's not very logical and there's an another way to obtain zinc)*.
 + `Name Tags` can be crafted with `Strings` and `Paper` *(this may be moved to a vanilla minecraft datapack in the future)*.

### Shapeless Crafting
 + `Clay Blocks` can be directly used in a crafting table to obtain `Clay Balls` instead of placing them and breaking them *(this may be moved to a vanilla minecraft datapack in the future)*.

### Crushing
 + `Crushed End Stone` can be obtained with `End Stone` through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + `Crushed Netherrack` can be obtained with `Netherrack` through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + `Silt` can be obtained with `Sand` through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + `Dust` can be obtained with `Silt` through Create's Crushing Wheel.

### Sifting
 + Adds a probability to obatin `Zinc Ingots` from sifting `Gravel`.

### Splashing / Bulk Washing
 + Spraying `Water` on `Dirt` with a `Mechanical Fan` will turn it into `Mud Blocks`.
