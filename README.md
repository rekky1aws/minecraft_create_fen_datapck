# Minecraft Datapack for Create and FabricaeExNihilo compatibilty

I'm making this datapack for my skyblock modpack based on Create and FabricaeExNihilo. It mostly add crafts using the two mods.

## Recipes
### Barrel
 + A zombie above a barrel with produce blood

### Shaped Crafting
 + Budding amethyst can be crafted with amethyst shards, emeralds and dimonds. It then can be automated with Create.
 + Zinc ingots can be crafted with Iron Ingots and Copper Ingots *(this may be removed in the future sicne it's not very logical and there's an another way to obtain zinc)*.
 + Name Tags can be crafted with strings and paper *(this may be moved to a vanilla minecraft datapack in the future)*.

### Shapeless Crafting
 + Clay blocks can be directly used in a crafting table to obtain clay balls instead of placing them and breaking them *(this may be moved to a vanilla minecraft datapack in the future)*.

### Crushing
 + Crushed End Stone can be obtained with End Stone through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + Crushed Netherrack can be obtained with Netherrack through Create's Crushing Wheel.
 + Crushed Silt can be obtained with Sand through Create's Crushing Wheel.
